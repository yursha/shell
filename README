Introduction
============

If you are a csh user and wish to convert your csh aliases to Bash
aliases, you may wish to use the script `examples/misc/alias-conv.sh'
as a starting point.  The script `examples/misc/cshtobash' is a
more ambitious script that attempts to do a more complete job.

Reporting Bugs
==============

Bug reports for bash should be sent to:

	bug-bash@gnu.org

using the `bashbug' program that is built and installed at the same
time as bash.

The discussion list `bug-bash@gnu.org' often contains information
about new ports of Bash, or discussions of new features or behavior
changes that people would like.  This mailing list is also available
as a usenet newsgroup: gnu.bash.bug. 

When you send a bug report, please use the `bashbug' program that is
built at the same time as bash.  If bash fails to build, try building
bashbug directly with `make bashbug'.  If you cannot build `bashbug',
please send mail to bug-bash@gnu.org with the following information:

	* the version number and release status of Bash (e.g., 2.05a-release)
	* the machine and OS that it is running on (you may run
	  `bashversion -l' from the bash build directory for this information)
	* a list of the compilation flags or the contents of `config.h', if
	  appropriate
	* a description of the bug
	* a recipe for recreating the bug reliably
	* a fix for the bug if you have one!

The `bashbug' program includes much of this automatically.

Questions and requests for help with bash and bash programming may be
sent to the help-bash@gnu.org mailing list.

If you would like to contact the Bash maintainers directly, send mail
to bash-maintainers@gnu.org.

While the Bash maintainers do not promise to fix all bugs, we would
like this shell to be the best that we can make it.

Enjoy!
